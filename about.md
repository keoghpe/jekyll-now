I'm a software developer from Dublin working at [Clinch](https://clinch.io).

### More Information

I love Ruby and Rails but I'm far more interested in products and important problems than development technologies. I'm happy to work in any language as long as there are tests. Off the internet I enjoy playing bass, climbing rocks and speaking bad Japanese and Mandarin.
